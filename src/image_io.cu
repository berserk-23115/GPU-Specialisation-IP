// CUDA-compatible wrapper for image I/O operations
// All actual implementations are in image_io_impl.cpp

// This file serves as a placeholder for CUDA compilation
// All function implementations are provided by image_io_impl.cpp
// which is compiled separately with C++ compiler to avoid
// C++17/filesystem conflicts with nvcc
